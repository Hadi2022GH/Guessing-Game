# Guessing-Game
I’m thinking of a number between 1 and 100…

	Prompts the user for a level, . If the user does not input a positive integer, the program should prompt again.
	Randomly generates an integer between 1 and , inclusive, using the random module.
	Prompts the user to guess that integer. If the guess is not a positive integer, the program should prompt the user again.
		If the guess is smaller than that integer, the program should output Too small! and prompt the user again.
		If the guess is larger than that integer, the program should output Too large! and prompt the user again.
		If the guess is the same as that integer, the program should output Just right! and exit.
		
I made some changes in the execution format of the game, which you will understand when you run it. I would appreciate it if you also help to make this program better by making changes to improve the program.
### Thanks
